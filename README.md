# pandas
This is the first thing I wrote with Python, unit tests, and CI!

It's very simple - just a Flask app that shows some fun stuff about Pandas.

I'm looking back at this two years later and seeing what I've learned since then (and making some updates based on the learnings :) ).


# Currently working on
I just added linting and some organization to the doc tree. Next up is improving the quality of the code.

# For the future
Review CD.
How to deal with secrets (i.e. terraform aws keys).
Add more fun stuff about pandas to explore flask further!
